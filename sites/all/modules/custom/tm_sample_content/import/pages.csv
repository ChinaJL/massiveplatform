However, we are happy to discuss joining forces with your group, the more the merrier (this has worked really well for us in some of our cities already)!<br/><br/></li><li><strong>Q:</strong> Why did the monkey get lost in the jungle?<br/><strong>A:</strong> <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7TklQTeuSE'>Because jungle is massive!</a><br/><br/></li></ul>"
